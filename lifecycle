Maven lifeCycle description:

compile: Compile the source code of the project.

clean: Removes files, such as .class files and .jar files, generated by previous builds.

javadoc: The maven-javadoc-plugin helps us generate project documentation (such as Javadoc) during the lifecycle

test reports: The "site" phase includes generating reports for test results. Test reports are often generated with
plugins like Surefire Report Plugin or Surefire Plugin. These reports gives us the result of unit or integration tests.

phase as it generates reports in .txt and .xml files.

package: Packages the compiled code into format such as .jar or .war.
